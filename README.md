# RouterAge_Delphi_chat
RouterAge - simple audio/video chat. 
I (my skype=chaky2222) took part in its development.... 
This chat now is dead project... 
And now i am sure - start project in C++ or delphi on server side - is not good idea.... 
Chat must use JSON, web server on server side and audio/video datasnap servers. 
I think Ruby or perl or python will be best... 

I can share sources - I have promise to it owner...
