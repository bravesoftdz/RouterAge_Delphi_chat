# RouterAge_Delphi_chat
RouterAge - simple audio/video chat. 
I (my skype=chaky2222) took part in its development.... <br>

This chat - dead project now... 
And now i am sure - start project in C++ or delphi on server side - is not good idea.... 
Chat must use JSON, web server (nginx or apache) on the server side and few audio/video datasnap servers (c++ or delphi or java) and (c++ or delphi or java) application on the client side. 
I think Ruby or perl or python will be best for it... 

I can not to share sources - I promised its owner... I can share only .exe files....
