# RouterAge_Delphi_chat
RouterAge - simple audio/video chat. ![Alt text](/img/2.jpg "RouterAge")<br><br>
I (my skype=chaky2222) took part in its development.... <br>
This chat - dead project now... <br>
And now i am sure - start project in C++ or delphi on server side - is not good idea.... <br>
Chat must use JSON, web server (nginx or apache) on the server side and few audio/video datasnap servers (c++ or delphi or java) and (c++ or delphi or java) application on the client side. <br>
I think Ruby or perl or python will be best for it... <br>

I can not to share sources - I promised its owner... I can share only .exe files....<br>
